Problem Statement
Genie's video store is a small, locally run video rental shop, which dealing mainly in classics movies and TV series. Jason, the store owner, for more than a decade, has used paper-based records to manage the videos items and the loan process. To catch up with the booming internet, Jason has decided to computerize its inventory, and conduct a computer-based rental process to better deal with the increasing number of items and the number of customers the store has to deal with. Furthermore, Jason also decided to include games as another line of rental products for his shop.
As a result, the video rental shop now deals with three basic types of items:
    • Old movie records
    • DVDs
    • Video games
